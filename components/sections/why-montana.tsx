              <p className="text-montana-muted mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We believe effective data protection starts with understanding business reality, not just technical requirements.
              </p>
              <p className="text-montana-muted mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                That is why our approach begins with risk, continuity, governance, and operational need. From there, we design and deliver the right mix of backup, recovery, transfer, security, and advisory support to create a solution that is fit for purpose, scalable, and practical to manage.
              </p>
              <p className="text-montana-muted leading-relaxed mb-8">
                For some clients, that means direct implementation and support. For others, it means a partner-enabled model that extends enterprise-grade capability into their own client environments.
